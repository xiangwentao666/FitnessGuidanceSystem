# FitnessGuidanceSystem
## Intelligent Fitness Guidance System Based on Posture Estimation and Segmentation Algorithms
## (The code was completed in June 2023 and it is coming soon!)
### Overview
This is a fitness project based on MediaPipe and rPPG that integrates skeletal keypoint recognition, heart rate detection, and physical training. A desktop application and a WeChat mini-program are developed for exercising and fitness knowledge quizzes, respectively. Additionally, it achieves interconnectivity and data exchange between the two platforms.

*Welcome to fork this project and actively raise issues, hoping it could be helpful to everyone!*

**NOTE**: This project is **ONLY a part of my INDIVIDUAL UNDERGRADUATE THESIS** for university graduation!
